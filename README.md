# Chat-Application-in-Java
The Chat Application project aimed to develop a simple client-server chat system using Java programming. The application allows users to communicate with each other in real-time over a network connection. The project utilized socket programming to establish communication channels between the client and server.

**Key Features:**
Real-time communication between multiple clients and a central server.
Concurrent handling of multiple client connections using multithreading.
Simple text-based interface for sending and receiving messages.
Ability for clients to gracefully terminate the chat session by sending an "exit" message.

**Project Outcome:**
The Chat Application project successfully demonstrated the implementation of a client-server communication system in Java. Through the utilization of socket programming and multithreading techniques, the application enables real-time messaging between multiple clients and a central server. The project provides a foundation for further enhancements, such as implementing user authentication, improving message handling, and incorporating graphical user interfaces for a more user-friendly experience.
